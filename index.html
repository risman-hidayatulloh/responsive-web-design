      <p class="details">
        In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you will learn the
        languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup
        Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
        First, you will build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and
        CSS. Later, you will learn modern techniques like CSS variables by
        building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a
        quiz site. Finally, you will learn how to make webpages that respond to
        different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a
        magazine article layout with CSS Grid.

              <p>
                HTML tags give a webpage its structure. You can use HTML tags to
                add photos, buttons, and other elements to your webpage. In this
                course, you'll learn the most common HTML tags by building your
                own cat photo app.
